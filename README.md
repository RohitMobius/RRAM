# RRAM
The attached is Verilog file of RRAM model, taken from Standord model.
A netlist of simulation of RRAM - Parametric analysis to analyse that min clock time period = 1usec 
The Vref required for this mode is min 1.5 to switch from reset to set state and -1.5v from set to reset hence minimun size of pdk used is gpdk 90nm
A netlist of RRAM based SRAM - 6T2R and 8T1R
The RRAM based SRAM can perform read, write, hold, store and restore- This is a non-volatile memory
